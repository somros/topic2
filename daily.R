# The monthly approach will not work here, we need to go to the finest time step
# Which, unfortunately, happens to be 12-hours
# So, ymonmean and ydaymean from CDO are no help here
# For maximum flexibility, use a hybrid approach of CDO and R
# In CDO: merge the annual NETCDF for historical and hindcast into one nc file
# in R, read in the netcdf file and transform it into a dataframe (it WILL be large)
# get time step index (be careful with leap years)
# Group by box, layer, julian day, and summarize: mean and sd for hindcast and historical run
# turn to array
# read in projection files one at a time
# apply deltas to projection
